## Logging

### General

**Log Levels**

By default in .NET Core there are six levels of logging (available through [LogLevel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loglevel?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) enum):
- `Trace` (value `0`) - the most detailed and verbosed information about the application flow, 
- `Debug` (`1`) - useful information during the development process (eg. local environment bug investigation),
- `Information` (`2`) - usually important information about the application flow that can be useful for diagnostics and flow, 
- `Warning` (`3`) - potential unexpected application event or error that's not blocking flow (eg. operation was successfully saved to database but notification failed) or transient error occurred but was succeeded after retry), 
- `Error` (`4`) - unexpected application error - eg. not record found to update, database timeout, argument exception etc.,
- `Critical` (`5`) - informing about critical events that require immediate action like application or system crash, end of disk space or database in irrecoverable state,
- `None` (`6`) - means no logs at all, used usually in the configuration to disable logging for selected category.

It's important to keep in mind that `Trace` and `Debug` should not be used on production, and should be used only for development/debugging purposes (`Trace` is by default disabled). 
Because of theirs characteristic they may contain sensitive application information to be effective (eg. system secrets, PII/GDPR Data). Because of that we need to be sure that on production environment they are disabled as that may end up with security leak. 
As they're also verbose, then keeping them on production system may increase significantly cost of logs storage. Plus too much logs make them unreadable and hard to read.

**Log Categories**

Each logger instance needs to have assigned category. Categories allows to group logs messages (as category will be added to each log entry).
By convention category should be passed as type parameter of [ILogger<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1). Usually it's the class that we're injecting logger, eg.

```csharp
[Route("api/Reservations")]
public class ReservationsController: Controller
{
    private readonly ILogger<ReservationsController> logger;

    public ReservationsController(ILogger<ReservationsController> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateTentative([FromBody] CreateReservationRequest request)
    {
        var reservationId = Guid.NewGuid();

        // (...) 

        logger.LogInformation("Created reservation with {ReservationId}", reservationId);
        
        
        return Created("api/Reservations", reservationId);
    }

}
```

Log category created with type parameter will contain full type name (so eg. `LoggingSamples.Controllers.ReservationController`).


It's also possible (however not recommended) to define that through [ILoggerFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.iloggerfactory?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) `CreateLogger(string categoryName)` method:

```csharp
[Route("api/Reservations")]
public class ReservationsController: Controller
{
    private readonly ILogger logger;

    public ReservationsController(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
        this.logger = logger.CreateLogger("LoggingSamples.Controllers.ReservationController");
    }
}
```

That is useful for searching through logs and issue diagnostics.
